# Accessor-TS

In TypeScript, there are two supported methods getter and setter to access and set the class members. The greater method control over how a member is accessed on each object.

when you define accessor you should have to be sure that your decorator access to which parameter in your class.

for example:

```
class Product {

    @Log
    private _price: number
    title: string //! that's other propertyName but this is shown when be closest to @Log

    constructor ( t: string, p: number ) {
        this.title = t
        this._price = p
    }


    set price ( val: number ) {
        if ( val > 0 ) this._price = val
        else throw new Error( 'Invalid price - should be positive!' )
    }



    getPriceWithTax ( tax: number ) {
        return this._price * ( 1 + tax )
    }

}

```

when you define your decorator like:

```
function Log ( target: any, name: string | symbol ) {
     console.log( "Property decorator:" )
     console.log( target )
     console.log( name )
}
```

- you can access to target (which in include all functions in your class, constructor too)
- also you can get name of closest property of decorator assigned to this like:

  ```
  private _price: number
  ```

  private environment variable called `_price`.

we can define other accessor method named: `Log2` like that:

```

function Log2 ( target: any, name: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor ) {
     console.log( 'Access decorator:' )
     console.log( target )
     console.log( name )
     console.log( descriptor, '2' )
}
```

and define it before `set price` like that:

```
class Product {
    @Log
    private _price: number
    title: string //! that's other propertyName but this is shown when be closest to @Log

    constructor ( t: string, p: number ) {
        this.title = t
        this._price = p
    }

    @Log2
    set price ( val: number ) {
        if ( val > 0 ) this._price = val
        else throw new Error( 'Invalid price - should be positive!' )
    }



    getPriceWithTax ( tax: number ) {
        return this._price * ( 1 + tax )
    }
}
```

in vanilla javascript we have `PropertyDescriptor`.
a `PropertyDescriptor` describes a property on an Object. Any JavaScript object can be used as a PropertyDescriptor where unspecified properties will be treated as undefined or false.

`PropertyDescriptor` has above keys.

- configurable (boolean)
- enumerable (boolean)
- get (getFunction)
- set (setFunction)
- value (object)
- writable (boolean)

if we do that, we let the decorator know that "hey let me target, name, description of price accessor".
so decorator passes these:

```
{ constructor, getPriceWithTax, set price }
price
{ get: undefined, enumerable: false, configurable: true, set: Æ’ }
```

we can deduce this from the above lines:
